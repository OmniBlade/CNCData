## bchunk v1.2.1 - BinChunker for Windows / Unix / Linux

binchunker converts a CD image in a ".bin / .cue" format (sometimes ".raw / .cue") to a set of .iso and .cdr tracks. The bin/cue format is used by some popular non-Unix cd-writing software, but is not supported on most other CD burning programs. A lot of CD/VCD images distributed on the Internet are in BIN/CUE format, I've been told.

This is a Windows/Unix/C rewrite of the fine BinChunker software. The non-Unix version of BinChunker has been obsoleted by the CD-R/W burning software FireBurner, which can be found at [www.fireburner.com](http://www.fireburner.com/). FireBurner does a lot more than BinChunker did, but can be used to do exactly the same even without a burner device installed. Thanks go to Bob Marietta <marietrg ( atz ] slu.edu>, the author of BinChunker, for the extensive help, documentation and letting me look at his Pascal/Delphi source code!</marietrg ( atz ] slu.edu>

### What on earth is this stuff?

The .iso track contains an ISO file system, which can be mounted through a loop device on Linux systems, or written on a CD-R using cdrecord. The .cdr tracks are in the native CD audio format. They can be either written on a CD-R using cdrecord -audio, or converted to WAV (or any other sound format for that matter) using sox. bchunk 1.1.0 (and later versions) can also output audio tracks in WAV format.

bchunk compiles and runs on any host with an ANSI C compiler, and somewhat POSIX.1 compliant environment. It has been tested on the following platforms:

- Linux 2.0, i686, glibc 2.0.7, gcc 2.7.2.3 (RedHat 5.1)  
- Linux 2.2, i686, glibc 2.1.1, egcs 1.1.2 (RedHat 6.0)  
- Linux 2.4, i686, glibc 2.2, gcc 2.96 (RedHat 7.0)  
- Linux 2.6, i686, glibc 2.3, gcc 3.2.2 (RedHat 9.0)  
- Linux 2.6, i686, glibc 2.3.5, gcc 4.0.2 (Debian sarge, etch)  
- Solaris 2.5.1, SPARC, gcc 2.7.2  
- Solaris 2.6, SPARC, gcc 2.8.1  
- Digital Unix 4.0c, Alpha, DEC C V5.2-033  
- SGI IRIX 6.5.7m, MIPS R4600 IP22, gcc 2.95.2  
- Mac OS X 10.1.4, gcc 2.95.2
- Windows 10, MSVC 14.0

OpenBSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD all have a port of bchunk available in their respective archives for a very good set of hardware platforms.

Debian GNU/Linux users can install bchunk 1.2.0 using 'apt-get install bchunk', as bchunk is maintained as a [Debian package](http://packages.debian.org/bchunk).

bchunk has apparently also been successfully compiled on BeOS without source modifications and the i386 binary can be [downloaded here](http://bezip.de/app/1340/).

### Tips and tricks:

**To record an MP3 image with a CUE sheet to an audio CD** (for example the mixes at [sicktracks.com](http://sicktracks.com/)):

1.  convert the .mp3 to a raw PCM audio file:  
    `$ mpg123 -sv sicktracks8.mp3 > sicktracks8.pcm`
2.  split into tracks according to the CUE file:  
    `$ bchunk sicktracks8.pcm sicktracks8.txt tracks`
3.  burn it:  
    `$ cdrecord -v -dao -audio tracks??.cdr`

If you only get loud noise on the tracks, try either -swab on cdrecord or -s on bchunk to swap the byte order.
